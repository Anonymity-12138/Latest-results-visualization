In order to re-evaluate the facial swapping effect of our proposed method, we compared RCLSwap again with the state-of-the-art method, InfoSwap, on this set of examples. Firstly, we acknowledge that on certain images, InfoSwap performs better than us in terms of restoring the eye region of the target face (indicated by the green bounding box). However, at the same time, we can also observe that RCLSwap outperforms InfoSwap in restoring facial attributes, for example, the **glasses legs** of the synthesized person in the third column **(indicated by the red bounding box)**. And in the fourth column, we can see that the boundary between the synthesized face and the background in InfoSwap is not clear, exhibiting obvious artifacts. Moreover, the black **dots on the face (indicated by the yellow bounding box)** are directly lost.

Secondly, these images have not undergone deliberate post-processing. Both the images generated by RCLSwap and InfoSwap are of size 512Ã—512 resolution. However, it can be noticed that the images synthesized by InfoSwap are more **blurry**, losing a significant amount of facial details from both the target and the source faces, resulting in an **overly smooth appearance**. On the other hand, the images synthesized by RCLSwap better restore the facial details, including **wrinkles and eye bags**. This may be attributed to the use of the StyleGAN framework, which has demonstrated excellent performance in synthesizing high-resolution images
